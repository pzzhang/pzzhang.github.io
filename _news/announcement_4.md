Gave a talk at <a href="https://hilbert.math.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Applied/ACMS/absS22#Pengchuan_Zhang_.28Microsoft.29">Applied and Computational Mathematics Seminar</a> at University of Wisconsin at Madison. The talk is about my ICLM 2021 work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05489">"Multiscale Invertible Generative Networks for High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference"</a>. The talk slides can be found at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_V0LgkA6-sryTqLo-rOtofFuJUeL0EO-/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
